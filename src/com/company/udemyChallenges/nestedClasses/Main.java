         4 major types of clases
         static  classes
         non-static nested classes (Inner classes)
         Local classes
         anonymous classes

         to call a static nested inner class, for examples a "Gear" class inside a "Gearbox" class, it goes thus;
         GearBox mcLaren = new GearBox();
         GearBox.Gear = mcLaren.new Gear();
